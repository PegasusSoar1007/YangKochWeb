My name is Veronika Kochetova and I am the cofounder of YangKoch™ Equestrian Breeches (2024). &nbsp; As of this writing I am 20 years old. I feel incredibly grateful to have this opportunity to share my product idea with you.</span></p><p><span class="bold">YangKoch™ Breeches are the safest riding breeches I've ever worn on a horse. &nbsp;They are my own product design and my dream now is to bring a deep sense of safety and security to the horse riding community worldwide.</span></p><p>If you would've asked my 18 year old self what I'd imagine Veronika Kochetova doing in March of 2024....</p><p>The answer would've been a little different than "designing safety breeches" and "seeking funding".</p><p>I would've said: "I see myself holding up a giant gold trophy at a World Cup Qualifier showjumping stadium in Europe - probably Aachen, Germany. &nbsp;My horse Vindicator is standing behind me in a blue, velvety blanket. We qualified for Paris 2024..."</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>My whole life I've wanted to be a top professional showjumper. &nbsp;To be in the big leagues. To win the Nations Cups, World Cups, World Championships and, of course, the Olympic Games one day.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="Me competing on different horses across USA (2018-2022)" data-id="44301052">

      <p>As a teen, I did my schooling at home and online so that I could be with horses, train and compete at showjumping events as much as time and money could allow.</p><p>When I turned 18, I wanted to be independent, not have to ask my family to support me financially. So I ventured out on my own in the horse sport industry.&nbsp;</p><p>I started training young sporthorses for a Sport Stable and fell in love with an adorable, incredibly talented horse I called "Hamster".</p><p>Soon we were winning consecutively in our division, and in early October of 2022, we even competed in the Young Horse National Championships in Princeton, New Jersey.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="Hamster and I winning our division at Wellington, FL and Saugerties, NY." data-id="44328207">

      <p>Although we did not win the Championship, I was so grateful to my horse and my trainers, and filled with immense excitement for where the future will take us.&nbsp;</p><p>I had my mind set on the nearest World Equestrian Games.</p><p>Yet, our future vision is not always as clear ahead as we may desire...</p><p>In the middle of that October, I was severely injured in a horse accident. &nbsp;I remember waking up in the hospital, and the middle-aged female surgeon listing which organs of mine had been removed. &nbsp;I remember seeing a Frankenstein looking stomach with 18 or 19 giant metal staples attaching one skin flap to the other.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="44301069">

      <p>If you're thinking I couldn't ride for a while after, you're more than right.</p><p>The first 2 weeks I could barely lift my spine higher than 90 degrees to slowly walk around.&nbsp;</p><p>I remember wondering if I'd ever walk straight again. If I'd ever ride a horse. I felt like something just grabbed 18 years worth of direction right from under me.</p><p>I didn't know what to do. I didn't even know who I was anymore. What am I meant to do?&nbsp;</p><p>Thankfully my family reached out to take care of me. But any hopes of support for horse sport was out of the question to my family.&nbsp;</p><p>And, I could barely walk...</p><p>How could I even continue to independently support myself and my horse passion?</p><p>I don't like to retrace the time following. I was quite depressed, and got extremely nervous entering a barn even. I'd get flashbacks and waves of fear would roll into my body.</p><p>Slowly, I recovered, adopted a cat for emotional stability, and tried to find myself again.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="My cat Kiki, who I &nbsp;adopted 3 weeks after my surgery" data-id="44328380">

      <p>Given how deep my injury was, I could not return to professional sport for many months. &nbsp;</p><p>The doctor told me if I were to get injured again, it could be much more serious due to the abdominal injury and surgical procedure I underwent.</p><p>I'll even admit this - I didn't have a desire to get back on a horse for 6 whole months after my surgery.</p><p>I would come to visit Hamster (my favorite horse) and hug him with all my heart and soul. I would go to the grassy green pastures and watch the beautiful horses grazing as the sun dipped below the horizon.</p><p>I was sure about one thing then and am sure about it now - I wanted horses to always be part of my life. &nbsp;And I want to help new riders and riders like myself <span class="bold">feel secure with our lifelong best friends</span>. &nbsp;</p><p>And that's why I started YangKoch™ Safety Riding Breeches.</p><p>With unrelenting support from my horse riding client and YangKoch™ cofounder, Nini Yang.</p><h3 id="h:-Why-These-Breeches-" class="page-anchor"><span class="bold">-Why These Breeches?-</span></h3><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="44316269">
